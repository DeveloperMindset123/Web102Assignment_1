## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges:
Majority of the website was built using HTML and CSS rather than react, for some reason, the react changes weren't showing up on my website and due to the lack of time, I had to resort to building the website in a more "traditional" fashion, I was considering adding additional features/props using react in addition to the HTML/CSS code, and no JavaScript code was needed but could have been added as part of feature.

I need to spend more time tinkering around with React to gain a better understanding of it's features, I replicated the layout of the website to the best of my abillities but I know there's significant room for improvement.
